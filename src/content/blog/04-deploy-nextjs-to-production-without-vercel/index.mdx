## Introduction

When it comes to deploying a Next.js app to production, generally everyone thinking starts from Vercel, and ends with Netlify, Firebase type providers. Not only are these providers very expensive, but they also have a lot of limitations.
A wrong configuration in your serverless function can lead to a big bill, like this [story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03f-JQlcDLA) where a Solo developer got a $100000 bill from Vercel because her app went viral.

So, you might be asking yourself, what we can do?

Unlike frameworks like Remix, you can not easily deploy a Next.js without going through hoops, especially if you checkout their .next folder.
But, the good news is that vercel hasn't left you without options. There is a simple way on how you can run a Next.js app using Node.js, without any serverless functions drama, direclty in optmized way.

We will go through steps by steps, this time on how we can make the most efficient Dockerized Next.js app.

### Setting up the project

1. Create a new Next.js app

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-app
```

2. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the app

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Create a Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

COPY . .

RUN npm install --production

RUN npm run build

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

This Dockerfile will build the Next.js app and install the dependencies in production mode, but its terrible for the performance and the size of the image will be huge.
